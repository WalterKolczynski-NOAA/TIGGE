Deployment, Use, and set up
=
Deployment is a manual process with some parts automated.
Thus it requires a human, preferably familiar with C gnu-make PERL and Crontab.

This program consists of two major parts:
1)  C-Code that builds with ECMWF GRIB API to calculate new data sections and updates GRIB2 headers.
	Produces 15015 grib records per cycle.

2) Inherited code from NCAR that runs ECMWF GRIB_API tools that 
	alter GRIB2 headers to conform to TIGGE requirements.
	Produce approximately 80000 Grib2 records per cycle.

 As of September 2017, this is a 5.1 GB tar package.

There are numerous PERL wrappers and a module that orchestrate dataflow 
  and aforementioned major components.



Dependancies:

This is a largely self-contained package.  It needs a few common things:
* gcc & make
* perl
* ECMWF GRIB API (pre-compiled CentOS 5&6 version is included in repo)
*	https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/GRIB/Home
* Input data from ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov   and/or NCEI Archive.
	Storage: (~32 GB per held cycle / 900 GB per week recommended retention)
* 	Source: ftp://ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/gens/prod/
*	Backup Source : NCEI DSI 6177_06.  too much latency to prefer over the NCEP source.
* 	If this data source dies, this program is useless until rewired to the new source.



Critical ENV VARS:

TIGGE_TOOLS
	Set this to the base deployment directory, it usually ends in /tigge.  Not the /bin
TIGGE_OUTPUT
	Structure where programs write output.
	The directory may be and should be a symbolic link.
	Recommended storage device hosting TIGGE_OUTPUT should be at least 1 terabyte capacity.
TIGGE_INPUT
	Point to the directory structure containing input data.
	Recommended storage is 1 terabyte per seven days of input you wish to retain.
	The more cycles kept here, the easier it is to correct real-time problems 
		before they become manual recall proceedures.
	Recommend no less then three days.
GRIB_DEFINITION_PATH
	Always = $TIGGE_TOOLS/grib-api/share/grib_api/definitions
GRIB_SAMPLES_PATH
	Always: $TIGGE_TOOLS/grib-api/share/grib_api/samples
	These two are needed for GRIB_API binaries to find their assets.
export PERL5LIB
	Point this to the directory containing PERL libaries found in this distribution. 
		(perl-tigge.tar.bz2)



Install process:

Not as automatic as it could be.  But this will do the job.

1#  git clone this distribution. (URL is above)
2#  cd into it.
3#  export the bashrc file that resides here.
4#  export the following enviornment (REQUIRED)
	export TIGGE_TOOLS="<the pwd>"
	export PERL5LIB="<path to local perl libs>"
		The main perl module that runs the utility programs is placed in here.
5#  Tell the makefile where to find Jasper. (if non-standard)
	export LIBS="-L<DIR path containing jasper.a>" /lib dir
		ex.  export LIBS="-L/path/to/jasper/lib"
	export INC="-I<DIR path containing jasper.h>" /include dir
		ex.  export INC="-I/path/to/jasper/include"
	o  If step #7 fails, you probably missed something here.
6#  cd src
7#  run [make]
	This will unpack the ECMWF GRIB-API, that is pre-compiled to CentOS6
	and proceed to use it to build the c code package.
	If there are make erorrs. You may need to clean, configure, and re-compile the ECMWF GRIB API that was placed in (../grib-api)
	ensure the binary ./ncdcTigge was actually created.
8#  Install, run [make install]
	This will slide everything necessary into $TIGGE_TOOLS/bin
9#  cd ../bin
10# Gather a cycle TIGGE_INPUT/<yyyymmddhh> of GENS files and test the distribution.
	Paths to GRIB_API binaries (/bin) should be appended to your shell PATH.
	Reference cron jobs below for help.

	perl runQcInput <yyyymmddhh> >&./rqi.log 
        ncdcTigge <yyyymmddhh> all
	perl runQcOutput.pl <yyyymmddhh>
	perl run_ncep_convert.pl <yyyymmddhh> >&./rnc.log
	perl finalize.pl <yyyymmddhh>

	If you get PERL module errors.  Ensure ncdcTigge.pm is in your PERL5LIB path.
	And use CPAN to install any further dependancies.
	Do internet search if not familiar with CPAN.

	Of course, ensure each step exits cleanly before proceeding to next.
	The PERL wrappers are generally easy to tell.   The binary ncdcTigge requires 
	  should be checked with runQcOutput.pl <yyyymmddhh>



Delivery to ECMWF:

 The end goal of this project is to provide the NCEP component of the THORPEX Grand 
   Global Ensemble to the master archive maintained by and at ECMWF.
 Links:
	master archive status * http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/tigge
	master archive access * http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/tigge/levtype=sfc/type=cf/

 Delivery % is in the upper 90% per year - meaning a few missed cycles are OK.

 Currently the transfer is done through NOMADS FTP site.

 The ECMWF Master archive is the only entity that needs the output data, so IP restrictions can 
   be implemented but thats not really needed as the data is rather harmless
   should someone randomly discover the directory.

Automation:  crontab

List of cron jobs to set up:

The launcher scripts are held in REPO/cron and may be moved, just alter
   the crontab execution path to match.
Meep, its C Shell.. get over it - its just echo text & system calls.
If you use them, must also set your $HOME/.cshrc to include the essential
    ENV vars mentioned in the set up section or they will NOT work,
-
[timings] $HOME/crontab/launch_tigge.csh 3  1>$HOME/crontab/logs/launch_tigge.log 2>&1
[timings] $HOME/crontab/launch_tigge.csh -8 1>$HOME/crontab/logs/launch_tigge.log 2>&1
[timings] $HOME/crontab/launch_tigge_ftp.csh 1>$HOME/crontab/logs/launch_tigge_ftp.log 2>&1
[timings] $HOME/crontab/launch_tigge_Recover.csh 1>$HOME/crontab/logs/launch_tigge_Recover.log 2>&1
[timings] $HOME/crontab/launch_tigge_Check.csh >$HOME/crontab/logs/tiggeRunCheck.log 2>&1
-
[timings] represent the five unit cron timing specifications.
Reference the cron daemon manual (man cron ? ) for details.

The first two jobs run the processor, the first runs 3 of the newest cycles, and
the second one runs eight of the oldest cycles (as a catch-up).  Systems vary, but its recommended
to run the first one as often as it takes for one cycle to finish.
The catch-up job should be run nightly at low-load times.  
The numbers 3 & -8 represent number of days to process, and are freely adjustable.

The third job obtains input data and should be run roughly 1-3 hourly.

The fourth job is an input data recovery job.   It looks back a week checking files 
   and automatically re-downloading missing inputs.   Should be run once a day at lest.
   This will NOT replace corrupted files!  only checks existance.

The fifth job is a e-mail notification for incomplete cycles.
   See more about that on Monitoring section below.

Finally, due to system & network oddities, another cron job on another machine had
   to be used to cp the completeda *kwbc*.tar files to a properly exposed delivery directory.
   This is a one line scp call using authorized keys.
   This is actually good, as it separates the delivery directory and production directory.


Monitoring:
=

Primary monitoring is done by e-mail.   The fifth cron job above launches a PERL program that
scans the $TIGGE_OUTPUT/archive for the expected series of 6-hourly *kwbc*.tar units.
It will check from the current date/time to the last file matching the pattern in the directory.  
If none are present, nothing will happen.
There needs to be at least one completed cycle, 
thus one may want to belay turning this cron job on until 
the automatic process is fully set up and churning out completed cycles.

A cycle will verify OK if the tar package is present and meets a minimum file byte size 
  ecified within the monitor script.  Currently this is around 4.5 GB.
  Monitoring script does nothing more then this.

E-mails should be sent to a group address.

This currently (Sept.2017) is: 

* To:   ncdc.nomadsmonitoring@noaa.gov
* Subj: [NCDC-TIGGE ./runCheck.pl] TIGGE run report


Fixing problems:
=

There is no rigid-methodical proceedure for doing this.

The general way, starts by noticing that a cycle has gone uncompleted for over 24 hours.
Monitoring staff need to glance over the monitoring e-mail daily.
Cycles ealier then this may still be running.

There are three major reasons cycles will fail:

1# Damaged or Missing Input data
2# Input data provider made a non-trivial change to the input data, that is
   tripping out the Input or Output quality control routines.
3# Full Disk

So --

cd to $TIGGE_TOOLS/bin and run perl ./runQcInput <yyyymmddhh>.
Don't watch it, come back in 15 mins and see if it passed or failed.
Most likely, it found 1 or several bad files.
If so -- rm these files then run ./runRecoverInput.pl to recover fresh copies.
Rerun ./runQcInput.pl -- If it succeeds, the next automatic run will take care of it.
If it does not... There are larger problems... perhaps #2 or #3 listed above.
Read the logs produced by the cron jobs... and good luck.  If its not #1-3 above, your
heading into - read the source code - territory.

Check the NWS TINS for any change notices to the input files.
(internet search - NWS TIN ensemble )

Unfortunately & Occassionally, 
 input file producer change will be made that will require an update to the 
 ECMWF GRIB API and even source code changes.  Call your local C programmer
 and pay them well..

This program sequence produces about 80000 files for one cycle.
Ensuring its all correct is very tedious.  Hope the output check
routines do it right.

If an output cycle is missed and goes beyond the 7 day window for retaining input data...
One can use manual-sequencer1 and 2 PERL scripts in /bin to rerun old cycles.  You will need to
  reobtain  the input data by any means necessary and check the first few lines of the PERL
 scripts on how to run them.
Create yourself an isolated Manual/Development area.
Branch your .bashrc to match the directories in the development area and source it whenever you
   need to go manual.
DO NOT put rerun input data into the standard $TIGGE_INPUT directory area!
Or it will probably get immediately deleted by the standard cron'ed purger.



Misc notes:

* Cycles to run are determined by the existance of a directories in TIGGE_INPUT/yyyymmddhh
* Runs are deemed completed using a flag file:  TIGGE_INPUT/yyyymmddhh/.complete
	removing this will trigger a rerun.
* The input and output QC routines also keep a flag file that needs to be removed to rerun the QC.
