THORPEX Interactive/International Grand Global Ensemble:

Deployment package.

This program consists of two parts:
1)  C-Code that used ECMWF GRIB API to calculate new data sections and update headers in GRIB data needed for TIGGE.  Produces 15015 grib records per cycle.

2) Inherited code from NCAR that runs ECMWF GRIB_API tools to convert headers-only.   Produces approx. 80000 Grib records per cycle.

Install process:
Not as automatic as it could be.  But this will do the job.

1#  git clone this distribution.
2#  cd into it.
3#  export the bashrc file that resides here.
4#  export the following enviornment (REQUIRED)
	export TIGGE_TOOLS="<the pwd>"
	export PERL5LIB="<path to local perl libs>"
		The main perl module that runs the utility programs is placed in here.
5#  Tell the makefile where to find Jasper. (if non-standard)
	export LIBS="DIR path to jasper.a /lib set"
	export INC="DIR path to jasper.h /include set"
	o  If step #7 fails, you probably missed something here.
6#  cd src
7#  run [make]
	This will unpack the ECMWF GRIB-API, that is pre-compiled to CentOS6
	and proceed to use it to build the c code package.
	If there are make erorrs. You may need to clean, configure, and re-compile the ECMWF GRIB API that was placed in (../grib-api)
	ensure the binary ./ncdcTigge was actually created.
8#  Install, run [make install]
	This will slide everything necessary into $TIGGE_TOOLS/bin
9#  cd ../bin
10# Gather a cycle TIGGE_INPUT/<yyyymmddhh> of GENS files and test the distribution.
	perl runQcInput <yyyymmddhh> >&./rqi.log 
        ncdcTigge <yyyymmddhh> all
	perl runQcOutput.pl <yyyymmddhh>
	perl run_ncep_convert.pl <yyyymmddhh> >&./rnc.log
        perl runQcInput <yyyymmddhh>
	perl finalize.pl <yyyymmddhh>

	If you get PERL module errors.  Ensure ncdcTigge.pm is in your PERL5LIB path.
	And use CPAN to install any further dependancies.

	Of course, ensure each step exits cleanly before proceeding to next.
        perl runQcInput <yyyymmddhh>
