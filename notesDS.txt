A perl script is executed via cron that calls an ECMWF GRIB API tool called "grib_convert".  "grib_convert" is run on all of the required native NCEP GRIB-2 fields/files using a configuration file that includes the text found at the end of this email.  "grib_convert" modifies the GRIB-2 headers and parameter encodings so that they conform to the TIGGE standards.

After this, the script runs the ECMWF GRIB API "grib_split" tool on all fields to split them into separate GRIB-2 messages where needed, and write all of the messages out

with the proper file naming convention.  I think Dan is familiar with the ECMWF GRIB API and its associated tools found in the "tigge" subdirectory.

In addition to the above steps, scripts are called to verify that all expected fields are available prior to being run through "grib_convert", and 
all expected fields are present after running "grib_split", before submitting them to the ldm server to be distributed to ECMWF.  If you put all of the fields in a
tar file as you do know for the partial NCEP data processing, I'm guessing ECMWF would be willing to grab those.

Dan, (concerning output QC)

The number I have is 77784 (not including tp, which is computed by ncdc).
TP is included in the native NCEP files (6 hour total accumulated precip) so
that might be showing up in your total.  Also, most of the parameters have a
fields at time step=0, so there are actually 65 time steps for those. "orog"
is only counted at time step=0, and fields such as mx2t6 and mn2t6 don't have
fields at timestep=0.

The inventory template I use to check NCEP cycle completeness is attached.
The columns include:
ensembletype,leveltype,forecasthour,ensemblenumber,levelvalue,tiggeparameter,productiontype
